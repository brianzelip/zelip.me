# Page-specific CSS

How to provide the ultimate optimization on page load?

- Nothing at all is best; but, we want to say something and look good doing it
- Inline all css for the page in `<head><style>...</style></head>`?
- have one css by default in the `<head>` for any shared css between pages, then have page-specific css in `<head></style>`?
