# Random hex color generation

Interesting math for something that's deceptively simple.

Watching John Otander's [Building randoma11y, a color voting app](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=garQJiJUxwk), lead to:

- Paul Irish's [Random Hex Color Code Generator in JavaScript](https://www.paulirish.com/2009/random-hex-color-code-snippets/)
  - lots of comments with folks adding to the discussion on how to generate a random hex color in js
- the !SO question [How do I randomly generate HTML hex color codes using JavaScript?](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/5092808/how-do-i-randomly-generate-html-hex-color-codes-using-javascript)
  - see the [answer](https://stackoverflow.com/a/5092872/2145103) that seems to be the best
  - this thread linked to another intersting thread, [Performance differences between color declarations?](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/6797306/performance-differences-between-color-declarations)
- i then started looking into a bit of css in js, particularly a [css tricks article](https://css-tricks.com/the-differing-perspectives-on-css-in-js/), and [emotion](https://emotion.sh/)
