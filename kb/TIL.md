# TIL / Today I Learned

I came across Simon Wilson's TIL subdomain yesterday, https://til.simonwillison.net.

This subdomain serves his TIL notes. Each note has a file name and belongs to a directory that is named after some category that the note belongs to.

It's essentially his personal knowledge base; really his entire site including subdomains is his knowledge base, but digging into how Simon W uses his website is the topic for another investigation.

There are TILs, then there are links, quotations, and more traditional blog 'entries'. There are various views associated with each of these content types, eg:
